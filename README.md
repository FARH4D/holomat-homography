# Holomat-Homography

This is simply a homography showcase and a tutorial for users who are trying to follow Concept-Bytes' Holomat tutorial and cannot figure out how to warp an image using a Charuco board.

I have a cheap projector so I could not get Charuco boards to work due to the low resolution, so I looked into a computer vision technique called Homography.

This method actually seems to be a lot simpler than using Charuco boards, because you don't have to go through the effort of taking multiple screenshots of a Charuco board on your desk and then calibrating it.
